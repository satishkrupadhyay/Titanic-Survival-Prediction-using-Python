# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-using-Python

Dataset Overview:

The data has been split into two groups:
training set (train.csv)
test set (test.csv)

The training set should be used to build our machine learning models. Our model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. we can also use feature engineering to create new features.

The test set should be used to see how well our model performs on unseen data.

What to predict:

For each passenger in the test set,Our model will be trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
